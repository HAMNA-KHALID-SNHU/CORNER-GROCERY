# 🛒 Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program

## 📌 Project Overview  
The Corner Grocer project was designed to analyze grocery purchase data and identify the frequency of each item sold during a day. This C++ program reads from a text file (`input.txt`), calculates how many times each item appears, and allows users to interact with this data through a menu-driven console interface. It includes features like item search, frequency listing, and histogram generation.



## ✅ What I Did Well  
I structured the code using **object-oriented programming**, separating data processing into a dedicated class and keeping the main logic clean and modular. The program is well-commented and follows consistent coding conventions, making it easy to understand and maintain. I also ensured that file I/O operations were handled safely, and the histogram output was clear and aligned.



## 🔧 Areas for Improvement  
Although the program works effectively, there are areas that could be improved:
- Implement input validation for unexpected user input
- Add exception handling for file access errors
- Use `unordered_map` instead of `map` for better lookup performance on large datasets
These enhancements would make the program more secure and efficient.



## 🔍 Challenges Faced and Overcome  
Creating the histogram output was tricky, especially formatting it to look clean in the console. I resolved this by researching console formatting techniques in C++ and testing different output strategies. I relied on resources like `cplusplus.com`, `GeeksforGeeks`, and community threads on `Stack Overflow` to troubleshoot and optimize my code.



## 🚀 Transferable Skills  
This project helped me grow in key programming areas:
- File handling and parsing in C++
- Use of data structures like `map`
- Writing maintainable object-oriented code
- Console-based UI/UX design
- Debugging and testing code under various scenarios

These skills will be useful in more advanced courses and real-world projects.



## 🔁 Code Maintainability  
To make the code easy to maintain and expand, I:
- Separated concerns using a dedicated class
- Used clear function names and modular code blocks
- Commented complex logic for future reference
- Designed a menu system that could easily support new features (like exporting reports or visual enhancements)
